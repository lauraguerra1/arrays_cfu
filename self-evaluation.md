# ARRAYS CFU SELF EVALUATION 
1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
    - I feel mostly confident with arrays so far. I am very confident about my udnerstanding of arrays that store strings and arrays that store numbers, but I think I need some more clarification on my understanding of arrays that store booleans.  
<br/>

2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
    - I am going to spend some time researchin how arrays that store booleans work before moving on to the next lesson.  
<br/>

3. What questions do you have about Arrays?
    - My question about arrays is in regards to booleans. When an array stores a boolean, such as `var collegeGraduate = [true, false, true, false]`, then what is each index position assigning the boolean to?  
    - I am going to do some further research on this question and deepen my understanding of arrays that store booleans. If I am still confused or find myself in an unproductive struggle, then I will send a message to my small group in slack.
